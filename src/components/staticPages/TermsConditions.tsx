      </p>
      <p>Governing Law</p>
      <p>
        No matter where you&rsquo;re located, the laws of the State of
        California will govern these Terms and the relationship between you and
        the Company as if you signed these Terms in California, without regard
        to California state&rsquo;s conflicts of laws rules. If any provisions
        of these Terms are inconsistent with any applicable law, those
        provisions will be superseded and/or modified only to the extent such
        provisions are inconsistent. The parties agree to submit to the federal
        or state courts in California for exclusive jurisdiction of any dispute
        arising out of or related to your use of the Services or your breach of
        these Terms.
      </p>
      <p>Arbitration</p>
      <p>
        At our sole discretion, we may require you to submit any disputes
        arising out of or relating to these Terms, including disputes arising
        from or concerning their interpretation, violation, invalidity,
        non-performance, or termination, to final and binding arbitration
        administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and
        Procedures. The arbitration shall be seated in San Francisco County or
        San Mateo County, California .
      </p>
      <p>Severability</p>
      <p>
        If it turns out that any part of these Terms is invalid, void, or for
        any reason unenforceable, that term will be deemed severable and limited
        or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary. The limitation or
        elimination of the term will not affect any other terms.
      </p>
      <p>Entire Agreement</p>
      <p>
        These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and the Company
        and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals,
        whether electronic, oral, or written with respect to these Services. Any
        rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.
      </p>
      <p>Force Majeure</p>
      <p>
        We take our commitment to customers seriously, and we&rsquo;ll do what
        we can for you. However, sometimes things may come up that are outside
        of our control. We will not be liable for any failure to perform any of
        our obligations stated in these Terms if the failure results from a
        cause beyond our reasonable control, including&mdash;without
        limitation&mdash;mechanical, electronic or communications failure or
        degradation, strikes or other labor disputes (whether or not relating to
        our workforce), restraints or delays affecting carriers, or our
        inability or delay in obtaining supplies of adequate or suitable
        materials.
      </p>
      <p>Assignment</p>
      <p>
        You cannot assign, transfer or sublicense these Terms without first
        obtaining our consent. We may assign, transfer, or delegate any of our
        rights and obligations without our prior written consent. These Terms do
        not create any agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment
        relationship, and neither party has any authority to bind the other in
        any respect.
      </p>
      <p>Waiver</p>
      <p>
        If we do not enforce any part of these Terms, it does not mean we give
        up the right to later enforce that or any other part of these Terms. In
        order for any waiver of compliance with these Terms to be binding, we
        must provide you with written notice of such waiver through one of our
        authorized representatives.
      </p>
      <p>Release</p>
      <p>
        You release the Company and our successors from all losses, damages,
        rights, and demands and actions of any kind, including personal
        injuries, death, and property damage, that are directly or indirectly
        related to or arise from your use of the Services (collectively,
        &ldquo;Claims&rdquo;). If you are a California resident, you hereby
        waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which states, &ldquo;A general
        release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party
        does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of
        executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have
        materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released
        party.&rdquo; This release does not apply to any Claims for
        unconscionable commercial practice by the Company or fraud, deception,
        false, promise, misrepresentation or concealment, or suppression or
        omission of any material fact in connection with the Services.
